This playbook performs a provision of topolvm on Arch Linux distributions 
(tested with Manjaro 20.06 on arm64 eg. RPI4) in the spirit of the deploy/README.md

What this play can do:
---------------------

Self-signed certificates are provisioned. Adaptation to other distributions should
be possible but it will require editing to handle differences between linux distros.
